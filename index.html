                <p>This week I decided to watch videos on creating animations using CSS. I went through a few videos regarding transforms and keyframes. I find with animations a lot of character is added to websites. The animations make it more interesting as a user to interact with a site. Even simple things like showing an item moving to ones cart, helps the user know that their item was added successfully. </p>
                <p>I began by first learning about how to transform objects. I learned that to begin you start with a line such as transform: translateX(200px) which just transforms the object along the x axis 200 pixels. You can follow this with other transformations such as rotate. This is an awesome tool for moving items across ones screen, but this does not have the animation moving on its own yet. </p>
                <p>Learning about keyframes is where I was able to see how the animation will move on its own. When creating a key frame you create a block using a @keyframe tag followed by a name. In the block you use “from{}” and “to{}” to show where you want the object to go. To assign the keyframe to the element you use “animation-name” and “animation-duration” to assign not only the animation but how long you want the animation to take. </p>

                <p>This week I was talking with my mom about a website I can create for my project. My mom has always wanted to create a site called “No mama, no mirror, no friends” where people can submit things for advice weather it be about clothes, relationships, or life. We were talking about different ways to make this happen but we both felt public comments could be an important part of a site like this. For this weeks blog post I looked into how to create a public comment section. </p>
                <p>In order to make this comment section possible, the videos I watched used PHP. With PHP it is easy to grab the text from the text boxes and format them the way you wish. You create a form called for example “post” and inside of it you include the fields you wish to include such as “name” and “comment”. Following this, before exiting the form, you include an input tag for a submit button. Inside of the php tag now you can use an if statement to catch that input: “if($_post)”. You then write the comments to a file where they will be added to the screen. Assuming you named the file “comments.html” you can add it to the screen by including another php tag under the form that looks like “<?php include “comments.html”; ?>”. </p>
