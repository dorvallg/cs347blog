                <p>This week I decided to watch videos on creating animations using CSS. I went through a few videos regarding transforms and keyframes. I find with animations a lot of character is added to websites. The animations make it more interesting as a user to interact with a site. Even simple things like showing an item moving to ones cart, helps the user know that their item was added successfully. </p>
                <p>I began by first learning about how to transform objects. I learned that to begin you start with a line such as transform: translateX(200px) which just transforms the object along the x axis 200 pixels. You can follow this with other transformations such as rotate. This is an awesome tool for moving items across ones screen, but this does not have the animation moving on its own yet. </p>
                <p>Learning about keyframes is where I was able to see how the animation will move on its own. When creating a key frame you create a block using a @keyframe tag followed by a name. In the block you use “from{}” and “to{}” to show where you want the object to go. To assign the keyframe to the element you use “animation-name” and “animation-duration” to assign not only the animation but how long you want the animation to take. </p>

                <p>This week I was talking with my mom about a website I can create for my project. My mom has always wanted to create a site called “No mama, no mirror, no friends” where people can submit things for advice weather it be about clothes, relationships, or life. We were talking about different ways to make this happen but we both felt public comments could be an important part of a site like this. For this weeks blog post I looked into how to create a public comment section. </p>
                <p>In order to make this comment section possible, the videos I watched used PHP. With PHP it is easy to grab the text from the text boxes and format them the way you wish. You create a form called for example “post” and inside of it you include the fields you wish to include such as “name” and “comment”. Following this, before exiting the form, you include an input tag for a submit button. Inside of the php tag now you can use an if statement to catch that input: “if($_post)”. You then write the comments to a file where they will be added to the screen. Assuming you named the file “comments.html” you can add it to the screen by including another php tag under the form that looks like “<?php include “comments.html”; ?>”. </p>

                <p>For this week I decided to look into grid layout with CSS. In earlier classes I found the Java swig grid layout to be very useful for a lot of things. I believe grid layouts make it very easy to organize different elements. I also looked into the float property and layouts that can be made with this. This property is helpful to have text wrap around images which is something I was looking to use in my project 1. </p>
                <p>Both float and the grid layout are fairly straight forward and simpler than I was expecting. In order to have an element float to the right of ones container all that is needed is “float: right”. This tool is simple yet very helping for things such as putting content see by side and almost make a grid effect with them. In order to use the grid layout you have to set the display by using “display: grid” as you would do with other layouts such as flex. You can use “grid-gap: x” to manipulate the space between the elements of the grid and use “grid-row-start” and “grid-row-end” to position an element across multiple blocks. </p>
                <p>With 4 images in a div with the id #grid, the below text puts them in a grid with 4 columns and 2 rows.</p>
                <pre>
                    #grid {
                        display: grid;
                        align-content: center;
                        grid-template-columns: auto auto auto auto;
                        grid-template-rows: auto auto;
                    }
                </pre>

                <p>I was wondering this week of how to create notifications on ones site. I learned this is only possible if your site is secured. You start by finding out if you have permission to display notifications. You do this by using “console.log(Notification.permission)”. This will return one of three cases determining if you can display notifications. If “granted” is returned you know you have permission otherwise if “default” is returned, you can request permission using “Notification.permission”. </p>
                <p>The best way to show these notifications is by creating a notification function where you create a notification variable and assign it to “new Notification(“text you want as header”, { body: “message you want to display” });” Then this function can be called inside of the if statement which validates that you are able to show the notification. Where body is inside of the brackets you can also add an icon attribute.  </p>

                <p>I decided to look into this week how much different it would be to embed a video into your webpage rather than an image. When researching this I found that before HTML you were unable to even do this unless the browser had a plug in. I also found that youtube will provide HTML code that can be used to add their videos to your pages. </p>
                <p>When adding a video to your page there are some attributes that must exist. Obviously one needs to use a video tag. Inside of the video tag there should be “src” “type” and “controls”. Src will hold the link to the video like it does with images and type will define the format of the file. With things such as input we use type as well to define what is going to be entered. Controls is a new concept to me and is used to allow for control of playback. Other attributes can also be added such as autoplay and loop. </p>
                <p>I found the following code to be helpful with understanding this topic.</p>
                <pre>
                    &lt;video width="320" height="240" controls&gt
                    &lt;source src=”http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.ogv” type=video/ogg&gt
                    &lt;source src="/build/videos/arcnet.io(7-sec).mp4" type=video/mp4&gt
                    &lt;/video&gt
