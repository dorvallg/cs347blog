                <p> This week I decided to watch videos on creating animations using CSS. I went through a few videos regarding transforms and keyframes. I find with animations a lot of character is added to websites. The animations make it more interesting as a user to interact with a site. Even simple things like showing an item moving to ones cart, helps the user know that their item was added successfully. </p>
                <p>I began by first learning about how to transform objects. I learned that to begin you start with a line such as transform: translateX(200px) which just transforms the object along the x axis 200 pixels. You can follow this with other transformations such as rotate. This is an awesome tool for moving items across ones screen, but this does not have the animation moving on its own yet. </p>
                <p>Learning about keyframes is where I was able to see how the animation will move on its own. When creating a key frame you create a block using a @keyframe tag followed by a name. In the block you use “from{}” and “to{}” to show where you want the object to go. To assign the keyframe to the element you use “animation-name” and “animation-duration” to assign not only the animation but how long you want the animation to take. </p>
